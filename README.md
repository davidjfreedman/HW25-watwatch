WAT? WATCH!


**Project:** Design and implement a fully functional stopwatch application.

**Description:** All of the functions of a stopwatch have been implemented and integrated in this application, including small details like the button text changing and the stop button's function (stopping AND resetting the clock) working during a pause.

**Why?:** It was a fun challenge to use JS's time-grabbing abilities to create a simple but useful everyday application. JQuery was lightly used to the extent that we had learned about it at the time, as a shorter way of accessing the DOM and affecting CSS. It provided some good obstacles in getting the data to display with the '0's padded out on smaller numbers, and making sure the buttons worked together correctly. The 'WAT' button will provide a chance to work with canvas and setting triggers at intervals.

**Tech used:** Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.

**Future updates:** In the next few weeks, the UI will be upgraded, and the 'WAT' button's functionality will be implemented.
